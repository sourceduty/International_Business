### Canada-USA

The United States and Canada share one of the longest and most economically significant international borders in the world, which has fostered a relationship characterized by deep economic integration, mutual defense commitments, and extensive cultural exchange. Economically, the two countries are profoundly intertwined; the U.S. is Canada's largest trading partner, and vice versa, with trade between them totaling hundreds of billions of dollars annually. This economic partnership is bolstered by agreements like the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which facilitates seamless trade and investment. Moreover, the defense ties are exemplified by their cooperation in the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD), a bi-national organization responsible for the aerospace and maritime defense of both nations.

Culturally and socially, the relationship is marked by a shared language and similar democratic values, which have led to a robust exchange of media, art, and education between the two countries. This cultural affinity makes the border highly porous, with citizens frequently traveling between the two countries for tourism, education, and work. Environmental and energy policies also represent a critical area of collaboration, with both nations working together on initiatives to protect their shared ecosystems and to promote sustainable energy use. This cooperation reflects a broader commitment to addressing global challenges collectively, underscoring the deep and multifaceted ties that define the U.S.-Canada relationship.
